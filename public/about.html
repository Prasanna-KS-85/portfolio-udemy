<h1>About Me</h1>
<h1>Myself Prasanna Kumar K S</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m a tech enthusiast with a strong foundation in cloud computing, machine learning, and full-stack development. I enjoy solving real-world problems using innovative technologies, and my academic and project experiences reflect this passion..</p>

<p>Over time, I've led cloud-based coursework groups, developed intelligent systems like a cyclone prediction model and a handwritten equation recognizer, and even ventured into business intelligence applications for healthcare. I'm particularly driven by how technology can serve people—evident in projects like an emergency alert device built with minimal hardware and an AI-powered ROP prediction model aimed at early diagnosis in premature infants.

My interests extend beyond code: I enjoy physics, doodling, swimming, and exploring creative outlets like 3D modeling using Blender. I’ve also contributed to socially responsible initiatives and led teams during tech fests and camps.

Whether it’s a blockchain-based decentralized portfolio, an AI-integrated smart city presentation, or a nutrition-focused meal planner, I strive to balance technical depth with user-centric design. I'm constantly learning, building, and growing—and I believe in using technology not just to automate, but to elevate lives.

Let’s connect and create something impactful.

</p>
